# Programming Projects

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/gitlet project/
-Gitlet description: A recreation of the git software that commits different versions of files, reports the status of the current working directory, and allows the user to revert to prior versions of their project.  This program allows a user to run 13 of the commonly used git commands.

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/cube project/
-Cube description: A pure strategy boardgame where each player is trying to convert all squares to their color or "side."
       In addition, this project contains an AI component that implements alpha beta pruning of a game tree (Java)
  
#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/enigma machine project/
-Enigma Machine description: A program that can encrpyt and decrypt messages sharing nearly all of the components from the WWII enigma machine. (Java)

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/colors project/
-Colors description: A game where the objective is to get make your board all one color, using a 2D array to store each square of the game (Java)

#### Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/bugs project/
-Bugs description:  A game in which a battle between ants and bees takes place.  There is a parent class "insects" that has children classes "ants" and "bees"; the ants and bees classes have many children themselves with differing attributes for each subclass. (Python)-(Inheritance, object-oriented programming, classes)

#### Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/typer project/
-Typer description:  A program that measures typing speed and implements typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it.  (Python)-(Recursion, abstraction, string manipulation, lists)

#### Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/piggy project/
-Piggy description:  Two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. (Python)-(Higher order functions, control statements, recursion)

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/Assignments/
-Assignments description: This folder contains lab/homework assignments that are much shorter and delve deeply into a specific topic.
