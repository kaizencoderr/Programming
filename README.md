# Programming Projects

This repo contains various projects I worked on in my computer science courses.

Below is a high level overview of each project with the associated path to the files for the given project:

Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/gitlet project/\
-Gitlet description: A recreation of the git software that commits different versions of files, reports the status of the current working directory, and allows the user to revert to prior versions of their project.  This program allows a user to run 13 of the commonly used git commands.

Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/cube project/\
-Cube description: A pure strategy boardgame where each player is trying to convert all squares to their color or "side."
       In addition, this project contains an AI component that implements alpha beta pruning of a game tree (Java)
  
Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/enigma machine project/\
-Enigma Machine description: A program that can encrpyt and decrypt messages sharing nearly all of the components from the WWII enigma machine. (Java)

Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/colors project/\
-Colors description: A game where the objective is to get make your board all one color, using a 2D array to store each square of the game (Java)

Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/bugs project/\
-Bugs description:  A game where ants battle against bees; heavily focused on OOP (Python)

Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/typer project/\
-Typer description:  A program that analyzes the speed and accuracy of a user's typing (Python)

Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/piggy project/\
-Piggy description:  A board game played with dice where the first player to 100 wins (Python)
