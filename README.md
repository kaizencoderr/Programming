# Programming Projects

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/gitlet project/
-Gitlet description: A recreation of the git software that commits different versions of files, reports the status of the current working directory, and allows the user to revert to prior versions of their project.  This program allows a user to run 13 of the commonly used git commands.

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/cube project/
-Cube description: A pure strategy boardgame where each player is trying to convert all squares to their color or "side."
       In addition, this project contains an AI component that implements alpha beta pruning of a game tree (Java)
  
#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/enigma machine project/
-Enigma Machine description: A simulator for a generalized version of the WWII German enigma machine.  This program takes descriptions of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode.  The details of the enigma machine can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine This version of the enigma machine uses the same components as the real enigma machine but generalizes beyond the alphabet. (Java)-(OOP, interfaces, comparables)

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/colors project/
-Colors description: A game played on a WÃ—H rectangular grid of square cells. Every square is colored from a set of available colors. The term active region refers to the set of grid cells having the same color as the upper-left cell and orthogonally reachable from that square. A cell is orthogonally reachable from a square S having color C if it can be reached by moving one square at a time up, down, left, or right starting from S and moving only to squares of color C.
Each time the player clicks on a square with a color different from that of the active region, all the cells currently in the active region take on that color. So if there are cells of this color adjacent to the active region, they get added to the active region.
The player's goal is to make all cells the same color by clicking a series of cells. The program sets an upper limit on the number of moves, depending on its own determination of how many moves are needed. (Java)-(OOP, arrays, hashsets)

#### Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/bugs project/
-Bugs description:  A game in which a battle between ants and bees takes place.  There is a parent class "insects" that has children classes "ants" and "bees"; the ants and bees classes have many children themselves with differing attributes for each subclass. (Python)-(Inheritance, object-oriented programming, classes)

#### Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/typer project/
-Typer description:  A program that measures typing speed and implements typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it.  (Python)-(Recursion, abstraction, string manipulation, lists)

#### Path: Programming/Structure of computer programs/piggy project/
-Piggy description:  Two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. (Python)-(Higher order functions, control statements, recursion)

#### Path: Programming/Data Structures + algorithms/Assignments/
-Assignments description: This folder contains lab/homework assignments that are much shorter and delve deeply into a specific topic.
